"A Bitlife clone in a single HTML file."

...Is what the original readme said, but as it's been four years and I still see people forking this every once in a while (presumably so they can try to run it in GitHub pages), I thought I should clarify: There is no functional game here, and what is here was written very badly. I wrote this when I was in 8th grade, and I don't even really make these types of projects any more. If you did want to make some sprt of BitLife clone in HTML/CSS/JS, you certainly could, but you should not look to this project for inspiration, as again, it's very bad.
